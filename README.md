Assignments for labs in ID1020, there are some instructions on what these codes can execute
To run these codes you would need to install the library from here https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/code/, after that the codes should be runnable via any compiler (I used IntelliJ)

"Supplementary Assignment.docx" was the report done for the course ME1003
